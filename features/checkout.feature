In order to make the right food
I need to see the orders that customers have placed

  | name         |
  | Starter      |
  | Main         |
  | Dessert      |

  And the following dishes exist
  | name                  | description          | price | category |

  | Not so Special Burger | Meat Burger          | 25    | Main     |

Scenario: A customer needs to be able to checkout
  Given I visit the menu page
  And I log in using "admin" and "admin"
  And I click on the "add" button

  Then I should see "Order was placed"
  And show me the page
